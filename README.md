# Virtualization-and-Containers

I completed the Virtualization and Containers course on TryHackMe . Here’s a quick summary of what I learned:

✅ Virtualization: Running multiple virtual machines on a single physical machine to improve efficiency and resource utilization.

✅ Hypervisors: Type 1 (bare metal) and Type 2 (hosted) hypervisors create abstraction layers for virtual machines.

✅ Containers: Share resources with the host OS, making them lightweight, portable, and robust for application deployment.

✅ Docker: Use images built from base images such as Alpine or Ubuntu to create and run containers, with Docker Hub simplifying the sharing and pulling of container images.

✅ Kubernetes: Manage containerized applications by automating scaling, self-healing, and rollouts/rollback, ensuring that applications remain available and responsive even as demand fluctuates.
